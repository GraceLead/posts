# What does that even mean?

## Jesus is the center of our relationship

Welcome to the first post of the series, “What does that even mean?”

*Nobody cares what you want to talk about! Communication occus at the intersection of what you want to talk about and the needs of your audience, and it is consumated when the audience is moved to take action at that intersection.

All of these can change as you go through the preparation
1. Subject:
	- What is the subject you want to write about?
		- Marriage, Jesus, Relationships, Needs & Strategies, Misunderstood Christian Phrases
	- Pick one:
		- Relationships
2. Central theme
	- What single aspect of the subject do you want to write about?
		- The central theme can't simply be another word tacked on like 'loving relationships,' or 'fear of relationships' - those are still subjects and too big to tackle - KDavis encourages the central theme being something much more specific that (I think) involves the person who is listening (otherwise, why would that person ever want to listen to what you have to say?)
			- So for example you could make it 'how to find a loving relationship', or 'why everyone needs to have a loving relationship' - 	- So upon hearing the central theme, the person knows - I'm not just going to read about this person's experience with loving relationships, but I'm going to learn about … how to find one, or why everyone needs one, etc...
		- How to make Jesus the center or foundation of your relationship
		- What it means for Jesus to be the center or foundation of your relationship
		- How to treat Jesus as a pagan good luck charm and claim he’s the center of your relationship
		- How people understand the phrase - “Jesus is the center of their marriage.”
		- Why it’s important that Jesus is the center or foundation of your relationship
	- Who is your audience? Be specific as possible:
		- Christian men and women who are in a relationship or want to be in a relationship where the Crucified and Risen God Man - Jesus Christ is the center and foundation of their relationship

3. Objective
	- Write the proposition - a proposal put forth for consideration or acceptance
		- You probably don't understand what it means for Jesus to be the foundation of your relationships
		- This is what it actually means for Jesus to be foundation of your relationships
		- You might think, say and, believe that the foundation of your relationship is Jesus, but in reality, you're probably treating him more like a pagan good luck charm, or a common interest that you both share.
		- If your marraige is rocky, look under the hood and find out if Jesus is the foundation of your marriage.
		- Every christian in a relationship can learn to make Jesus the foundation of their relationship
		- Every christian in a relationship can dupe themselves into thinking Jesus is the foundation of their relationship
		- Every christian in a relationship should build the foundation of their relationship on Jesus
		- Every christian can build their relationship on the foundation of Jesus
		- Every christian in a relationship can root themsevles in their relationship or relationship with Jesus
		-

	- What's the action I want people to take after reading this post and watching this presentation video?
		- I want them to take some time to examine their heart, feelings, needs, desires, goals and expectations, and determine whether Jesus is the foundation of their relationships
		- I want them to examine their hearts
		- I want them to run their heart regarding their relationship through the obstacle course of feelings, needs, and strategies.
		- I want them to return to Jesus and rest in him as the foundation of their relationship
		- I want them to determine how much they first go to Christ with their needs in comparison to holding their spouse responsible for meeting their needs.
		- I want them to worship Jesus who did not come for them as successful relationship builders or people who have successful relationships - but as the God Man who came down to rescue us who have broken relationships and who do relationships poorly.
