# What does that even mean?

## Jesus is the center of our relationship

Welcome to the first post of the series, “What does that even mean?”

*Nobody cares what you want to talk about! Communication occus at the intersection of what you want to talk about and the needs of your audience, and it is consumated when the audience is moved to take action at that intersection.

All of these can change as you go through the preparation
1. Subject:
	- What is the subject you want to write about?
		- Marriage, Jesus, Relationships, Needs & Strategies, Misunderstood Christian Phrases
	- Pick one:
		- Relationships
2. Central theme
	- What is the central theme?
		- The central theme can't simply be another word tacked on like 'loving relationships,' or 'fear of relationships' - those are still subjects and too big to tackle - KD encourages the central theme to be something much more specific that (I think) involves the person who is listening (otherwise, why would that person ever want to listen to what you have to say?)
			- So for example you could make it 'how to find a loving relationship', or 'why everyone needs to have a loving relationship' - 	- So upon hearing the central theme, the person knows - I'm not just going to read about this person's experience with loving relationships, but I'm going to learn about something that can affect me… how to find a loving relationship, or why everyone needs a loving relationship, etc...
	- What single aspect of the subject (God-centered relationships) do you want to write about?
		- How to have a God centered relationship
		- What it looks like to have a God centered relationship
		- How a God centered relationship is different than God being a shared interest
		- What it means for Jesus to be the center or foundation of your relationship
		- How to treat Jesus as a pagan good luck charm and claim he’s the center of your relationship
		- How people understand the phrase - “Jesus is the center of their marriage.”
		- Why it’s important that Jesus is the center or foundation of your relationship
	- Who is your audience? Be specific as possible:
		- Christian men and women who are in a relationship or want to be in a relationship where the Crucified and Risen God Man - Jesus Christ is the center and foundation of their relationship
		- Ministry leaders that want to work on their relationships and make them better

3. Objective
	- What is the objective sentence?
		- it is a sentence containing a proposition (that identifies your objective and begs the qustion how or why), an interogative response (that answers the question how or why), and shows how you are going to accomplish that objective - it also contains a key word.
	- Write the proposition - a proposal put forth for consideration or acceptance - it identifies the objective of the presentation - causes the listener to ask how or why? provides a powerful focus for the points of your presentation - makes a transition from what you want to talk about to what you want to accomplish - comprises the first half of your objective sentence
		- a proposition persuading the audience to action or consideration -or according to KD - an informative proposition instructs or encourages the audience - it shows people how to do something
		- Even if your speech is prepared around a pesuasive presentation, it doesn't have to sound like 'SHOULD' - remember that determining this objective is within the preparation - it is not the presentation


		- You probably don't understand what it means for Jesus to be the foundation of your relationships
		- This is what it actually means for Jesus to be foundation of your relationships
		- You might think, say and, believe that the foundation of your relationship is Jesus, but in reality, you're probably treating him more like a pagan good luck charm, or a common interest that you both share.
		- If your marraige is rocky, look under the hood and find out if Jesus is the foundation of your marriage.
		- Every christian in a relationship can learn to make Jesus the foundation of their relationship
		- Every christian in a relationship can dupe themselves into thinking Jesus is the foundation of their relationship
		- Every christian in a relationship should build the foundation of their relationship on Jesus
		- Every christian can build their relationship on the foundation of Jesus
		- Every christian in a relationship can root themsevles in their relationship or relationship with Jesus
		- Every couple can have life giving relationship by rooting themselves in Christ
		- Every couple can feel free in their relationship by building their relationship on Jesus
		- Every couple can

	- What's the action I want people to take after reading this post and watching this presentation video?
		- I want them to take some time to examine their heart, feelings, needs, desires, goals and expectations, and determine whether Jesus is the foundation of their relationships
		- I want them to examine their hearts
		- I want them to run their heart regarding their relationship through the obstacle course of feelings, needs, and strategies.
		- I want them to return to Jesus and rest in him as the foundation of their relationship
		- I want them to determine how much they first go to Christ with their needs in comparison to holding their spouse responsible for meeting their needs.
		- I want them to worship Jesus who did not come for them as successful relationship builders or people who have successful relationships - but as the God Man who came down to rescue us who have broken relationships and who do relationships poorly.

6. Evaluation


This is what I want to talk about regarding Christ being the center or foundation of the relationship:

I've seen so many different married couples and dating couples (and experienced this myself) - where they enter a relationship and think that it will go swell because the other peson is Christian. Or they confidently state that Jesus is, or is going to be the foundation of their relationship - but they quickly discover that simply dating another christian, or worse, simply marrying another christian doesn't make their relationship any better, in fact, it sometimes gets in the way of them expressing themselves - it adds an extra difficulty to the relationship because they feel tied down by all the things that they have learned a good christian husband or wife is supposed to say and do - lay down their preferences for one another, respect him, love her, be slow to speak and quick to listen, doing unto the other as they would have done unto them (or doing unto the other as the other would have them do unto them) And it really puts a stick in their wheel - and so they find themselves thinking, and sometimes forgoing all their christian lessons - and proceed to let loose a torrent of obvious criticism and complaints that any normal person would see or would do if they weren't such a bumbling buffoon.

And they are attending a small group, and are trying their hardest to read the word, and pray, not every morning - but who does? We aren't George Mueller. And so they they are doign their best be be faithful Christians - some are pastors, some are elders, directors of ministry, small group leaders, etc … but for some reason, even though they have sought to put Christ at the center of their relationship - praying together, going to church and small group together - trying to memorize scripture together, they never-the-less find that their relationship becomes very difficult, and the hoped for fulfillment they thought marriage or a relationship would provide, slowly turns to a lingering dissapointment, in some a hopelessness, and in others despair.

Perhaps the reason this is so, is because Christ wasn't the center of their relationship, nor the foundation upon which they built their relationship. That's my proposal put forth for consideration and acceptance. Why christian relationships often aren't actually relationships with Christ at the center or foundation. Why not?
