## Manfred Max-Neef's Fundamental human needs
From Wikipedia and Human Scale Development:
> "focused and based on the satisfaction of fundamental human needs, on the generation of growing levels of self-reliance, and on the construction of organic articulations of people with nature and technology, of global processes with local activity, of the personal with the social, of planning with autonomy and of civil society with the state. Human needs, self-reliance, and organic articulations are the pillars which support Human Scale Development." Human Scale Development "assumes a direct and participatory democracy. This form of democracy nurtures those conditions that will help to transform the traditional, semi-paternalistic role of the Latin American state into a role of encouraging creative solutions flowing from the bottom upwards. This is more consistent with the real expectations of the people."[2]

The X axis are existential needs (Being, Having, Doing, Interacting), while the Y axis are axiological needs ( 9 needs related to human values ), and at their intersection is the satisfiers of those needs.

So I suppose he believes are 36 different flavors of human needs as our values intersect with our existence.
